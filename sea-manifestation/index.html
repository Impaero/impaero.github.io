<!-- Gonna write this here so I don't lose track of my to-do list.
- Create the following assets:
    1) Artwork of the creatures (at least coloured sketch since rendered DOES take a while)
    The aim is to have at least two per zone, ideal is three.
        a) "Confidence" (check) -> (epipelagic)
        b) "Scopephobia" (check by technicality) -> (bathypelagic)
        c) "Living Whalefall" (not done) -> this one is basically like an overworked person trying to take care of people (mesopelagic)
        d) "Impulsitivity" (not done) -> electric eels within bathypelagic zone
        e) "Herd Mentality" (not done) -> mesopelagic, basically a school of fish with brain inside of them
        f) "Calm" (not done) -> calm fishy fish just vibe (epipelagic)
        g) The Leviathan (not done) -> just show an eye or something to show the massive scale of it (abyssopelagic)
 
    2) Rift Watch logo.
    3) Buttons? probably make it in uhh whatsitmacalled. illustrator yeah

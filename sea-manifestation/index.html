Gonna write this here so I don't lose track of my to-do list.
- Create the following assets:
    1) Artwork of the creatures (at least coloured sketch since rendered DOES take a while)
    The aim is to have at least two per zone, ideal is three.
        a) "Confidence" (check) -> (epipelagic)
        b) "Scopephobia" (check by technicality) -> (bathypelagic)
        c) "Living Whalefall" (check) -> this one is basically like an overworked person trying to take care of people (mesopelagic)
            also basically just a whale that is taking care of younger fishes by letting them feed on it
        d) "Impulsitivity" (check) -> electric eels within bathypelagic zone
        e) "Herd Mentality" (check) -> mesopelagic, basically a school of fish with brain inside of them
        f) "Calm" (check) -> calm fishy fish just vibe (epipelagic)
        g) The Leviathan (check) -> just show an eye or something to show the massive scale of it (abyssopelagic)
 
    2) Rift Watch logo.
    3) Buttons? probably make it in uhh whatsitmacalled. illustrator yeah. On second thought, I'll probably just make it in html or
        something so I can save some time.

Its aggressiveness must not be underestimated, seeing as it can drive away even the most dangerous of manifestations within the rift’s epipelagic zone.\n\nWe thought that its visibility might affect its survivability, but it seems that it does not care about such things. Even our █████████ was not able to acquire even the tiniest of its flesh due to it being able to swim away confidently."

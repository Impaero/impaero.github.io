Its aggressiveness must not be underestimated, seeing as it can drive away even the most dangerous of manifestations within the rift’s epipelagic zone.\n\nWe thought that its visibility might affect its survivability, but it seems that it does not care about such things. Even our █████████ was not able to acquire even the tiniest of its flesh due to it being able to swim away confidently."

Some say it is an eel, others say it is an elongated shark, but the closest guess we have is a telescope fish. The reason being, other than its form, is that the cameras it has as its eyes seem to unsettle those who are near B-7.\n\nThus, the assigned name \"Scopophobia\" fits well with its unnerving eyes. It roams around, cameras focused on movement or presences around the rift's bathypelagic zone. Several of the agents we have sent in various ██████████s that did encounter B-7 in some form have unnatural psychosis - some say they have seen █████, others felt ████████, but one thing is common amongst everyone affected.\n\nBeing watched."
